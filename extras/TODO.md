## Things I need to check

* Check the circuit using 10pF cap instead 22pF connected to the crystal;
* Check the circuit with GND and RF GND separated;
* Check the circuit with VA and VD powered with different sources;
* Measuring the capacitance of AMI and FMI with the command setTuneFrequencyAntennaCapacitor(n)
