# Schematics and Sketches


Please, also check the comments at the beginning of each sketch example available in this library. You will find the SI473X, button, encoder, display and Arduino settings.

## Standalone ATmega328 with or without external Crystal (SI4735-D60 and LCD 16x2). 

The schematic below can be also used with a regular Arduino Board based on ATmega328. It is almost the same circuit posted by Mirko Pavleski on his [Arduino Project repository](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/mircemk/diy-si4730-all-band-radio-lw-mw-sw-fm-1894d9). If you use an SI4735-D60 or SI4732-A10, you can have a All band receiver with FM, AM and SSB modes.

Please, use the [MiniCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) setup on your Arduino IDE to deal with standalone Atmega328.


## Basic schematic with TFT

The schematic below guides you to build your own receiver based on the SI473X with TFT display. The sketches available on [examples/SI47XX_04_TFT/](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_04_TFT) folder decribe the wire up used by the TFT selected by the author. Please, at the beginning of each sketch example.

## Attiny85 basic circuit

You can use de Si4735 Arduino Library on the very small ATtiny85 or Attiny84. The schematic below can guide you to build a receiver based on attiny85 device.

## External Mute Circuit 

The SI47XX devices have about DC bias component in the analog audio output pins (SI4735-D60 pins 23 and 24). When the device goes to power down mode, the voltage on the audio pins drops to 0V.  The device do it internally and there is not a way to avoid that. When the device goes to power up, that audio pins suddenly goes to high DC again. This transition causes the loud pop in the speaker. It is possible to solve this problem by adding an extra __mute__ circuit and control it by the MCU (Atmega, ESP32, STM32, ATtiny85 etc).

Considering that you are using a MCU based on Atmega328, when the D14 is HIGH the Si47XX output audio will be drained to the ground. At this condition, no audio will be transferred to the amplifier input and, consequently, to the speaker. So, no loud click in the speaker. 

When the D14 is LOW, the most of signal audio output from the Si47XX will be transfered to the input of the amplifier. 

The code below shows all you have to do in your sketch to implement this resource.


```cpp

#include <SI4735.h>
#define AUDIO_MUTE 14      // Pin A0 - Switch AGC ON/OF

Si4735 r;

void setup() {
  .
  
  // It is all you have to do to control a external audio mute circuit if you have one. 
  r.setAudioMuteMcuPin(AUDIO_MUTE); // Tells the system to control an external audio mute circuit. 

  r.setup(RESET_PIN, -1, 1, SI473X_ANALOG_AUDIO); // Starts on FM mode and ANALOG audio mode. 
  .
  .
  .

} 
```

Some low power audio amplifiers IC also implement mute circuit that can be controlled externally.
