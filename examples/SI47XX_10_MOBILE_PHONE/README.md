# iOS and Android Remote Control

This example shows a way to use your smartphone as a remote control via Bluetooth. In order to follow the steps presented here, I am assuming that you have some knowledge in development for mobile devices. Also, you will need to be familiar with the Javascript programming language.

The development environment used for this example is the [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/index.html). Cordova is a open-source mobile development framework that allows you to develop cross-platform applications. That means you can code once and deploy the application in many system, including iOS and Android. 
Cordova provides an easy way to develop for iOS and Android.


The video below shows you this example working.
